Compound Audits
===============

## Disclaimer

Building correct software is hard, and the Compound Engineering team has put considerable effort, through its own engineers and third-party auditors, to provide smart contracts that we believe are safe and correct. Please note, however, that **Compound is experimental software** and there are inherent risks in interacting with these Ethereum smart contract. Please do not put funds at risk that you would not be willing to lose.

## Audits

Compound has completed two full audits of its version 2 Protocol. Compound will continue to solicit audits of the protocol and provide updates as those audits are released. We encourage interested third-parties or community members to perform high-quality audits, and we will release those audits, as well, here.

A word of caution: these audits are intended to help the engineers building the protocol identify potential flaws in the design or implementation. The audit reports do not, therefore, simply state the protocol is safe, but instead enumerate concerns and ensure that the company has adequately addressed those concerns. It's suggested, if you're reading the audits, to read them in full to get a complete understanding of the issues and context involved.
